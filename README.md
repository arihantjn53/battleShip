# Requirements

- JAVA 1.8

# Usage

- Git clone the source code
- Load the project in IDE and run Main.java

  OR

- Build the project in IDE
- Run the `Main.class` in `out/production` using

```bash
java Main
```

# Input

- First line of the input contains dimensions of battle area having width and height separated by space.
- Then the next line will have number (B) of battleships each player has.
- Then in the next line battleship type, dimensions (width and height) & positions (Y coordinate and X coordinate) for Player-1 and then for Player-2 will be given separated by space.
- And then in the next line Player-1â€™s sequence (separated by space) of missiles target location coordinates (Y and X) will be given and then for sequence for Player-2.

## Input Constraints

- 1 <= Width of Battle Area (M) <= 9
- A <= Height of Battle Area (N) <= Z
- 1 <= Number of Battleships <= M \* N
- Type of Ship = {'P', 'Q'}
- 1 <= Width of Battleship <= M
- A <= Height of battleship <= N
- 1 <= X coordinate of ship <= M
- A <= Y coordinate of ship <= N
